# AV TEST

This repository is designed to **test antivirus (AV) detection capabilities** using the industry-standard **EICAR test file**.  
The EICAR file is a safe, non-malicious string created by the [European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR)](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950) to verify that antivirus software is correctly installed and functioning.

## What is the EICAR Test File?

- The **EICAR test file** is a harmless text file that triggers antivirus alerts.  
- It is **not a virus**, but AV engines treat it as one for testing purposes.  
- This allows developers, researchers, and IT teams to confirm that their AV solutions are active and responsive without using real malware.
